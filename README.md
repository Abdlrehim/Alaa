`Explain all test cases`

- `should check if the help center icon exists and is clickable`

This test case checks if the help center icon with the CSS class "intercom-launcher" is visible on the page and has the attribute "aria-label" set to "Open Intercom Messenger".
If the icon exists and is disabled (aria-label is not "Open Intercom Messenger"), the test logs a message and returns.
If the icon exists and is enabled, the test logs a message and clicks on the icon.

- `should verify that clicking the icon opens up a popup with search bar`

This test case simulates clicking on the help center icon (assuming it is enabled) by finding the element with the CSS class "intercom-launcher" and triggering a click event.
It then retrieves the iframe element with the CSS class "intercom-messenger-frame" and performs assertions within its contents.
Within the iframe, it checks if an element with the CSS class "intercom-5edou6" (presumably the search bar) is visible and clicks on it.
Finally, it checks if an element with the CSS class "intercom-mt46on" (the popup containing the search bar) is visible and within it, checks if an element with the CSS class "search-input-placeholder" contains the text "Search for help".

- `should search for "Rollup" and verify the results`

This test case is similar to the previous one. It simulates clicking on the help center icon, finds the iframe, and performs assertions within its contents.
It clicks on the search bar element and types the text "Rollup" using the type() command.
Then, it checks if any list items with the CSS class "intercom-o9b79t" are visible and contain the text "Roll".
